# Hangman Game!
I programmed the game to be played in the command line. The instructions are all printed along with your progress as you go!
The best way to run it is through IntelliJ (which is where I coded it) The JAR exectutables I made didn't like the ASCII characters used for the gallows, so running main is the best experience!
